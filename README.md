### Hi there! My name is Aaron Schuster and I'm currently in BloomTech's full stack web developer program. I've been interested in computers and software development for a long time! My dad is a (soon to be retired) software developer so talking computers has always been around for me. In addition to CSS, HTML and Javascript that I've been learning with BloomTech I also have some experience with C, C++ and Pascal. 
  I've been married since May 2019 and am a father of a little 1 year old girl! Some of my hobbies include traveling around the country to amusement/theme parks and indoor rock climbing!
  
Please feel free to reach out to me via email: aaronjschuster@gmail.com
