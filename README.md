### Hi there!  My name is Aaron Schuster and I'm currently in BloomTech's full stack web developer program. :computer:

---

Currently, I'm working hands-on with JavaScript (including React), HTML and CSS to build out cloud-native web applications and specific software feature components. I have had an interest in computers and software development for a long time and I have worked with C, C++, Pascal (Delphi), and Java tech stacks previously. **I'm very excited to keep learning and dive into a career in web development!**

Talking computers has been around for me my whole life as my dad is a (soon to be retired) software developer! I've been married since May 2019 and am a father of a little 1 year old girl! I live the in sporadically beautiful Cleveland OH :grin: Some of my hobbies include traveling around the country to amusement/theme parks ðŸŽ¢  and indoor rock climbing!
